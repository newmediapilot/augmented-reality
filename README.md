# victoR gad :: Augmented Reality

This project is an AR experience built with A-Frame and AR.js, showcasing 62 markers, each displaying a unique image. The AR scene uses barcodes to display images as floating 3D objects that can be viewed on a mobile device.

## Setup

   - Ensure the `markers` folder is in the same directory as the HTML file, containing images named `slide1.png` to `slide62.png`.
   - This project requires HTTPS for AR functionality. The code redirects automatically if accessed via HTTP.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a browser that supports WebXR.
2. Point your device camera at the printed or digital barcode markers to see each associated image in AR.
